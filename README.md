# 📱 Vehicle Audit Power App

A custom Power App designed to streamline vehicle auditing by enabling real-time defect entry, automated data processing, and integration with Power BI dashboards for analysis. Built to replace manual audit spreadsheets and improve operational visibility.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 **Multi-Defect Entry**:
  - Allows auditors to submit multiple defects per vehicle in a single entry.
  - Supports both *Delivery* and *Procedure* defect categories.
- ⚡ **Automated Workflows**:
  - Power Automate integration pushes entries to SharePoint and triggers data refreshes.
- 📊 **Instant Insights**:
  - Seamless integration with Power BI dashboards for real-time KPI updates.
- 🔍 **Hybrid Gallery/Form UI**:
  - Combines dropdown-based defect selection with quick submission for faster audits.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**:
  - Optimized for use on tablets and phones for on-the-ground auditing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power Apps**: Front-end for audit entry, dynamic UI for defect categories.
- **Power Automate**: Automated data pipelines and notifications.
- **SharePoint**: Backend data storage.
- **Power BI**: Visualization and reporting of audit trends and KPIs.
- **Power Fx**: Custom logic for UI/UX and data validation.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Auditor selects a vehicle and defect category (Delivery or Procedure).
2. Multiple defects can be entered at once via dropdown selections.
3. On submit:
   - Power Automate saves the entries to a SharePoint list.
   - Triggers Power BI to refresh KPIs and dashboards.
4. Managers view real-time data via the Vehicle Audit Dashboard.

## 📊 Business Impact
- Eliminated manual spreadsheets and reduced data entry errors from auditors.
- Provided near real-time visibility into defect trends and concern points.
- Accelerated issue identification and corrective action for operations.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add offline mode for auditing in areas without network connectivity.
- Implement role-based access for different auditor levels.
